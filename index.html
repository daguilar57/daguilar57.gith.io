        <p>Hi, My name is Diego Aguilar, some things about me: I have grew up and lived in Albuquerque my whole life. My
            favorite (current) music artist is Matt Maltease. He makes a lot of love songs. I have been interested in Tech
            and tinkering with stuff since I was a little boy whenever my dad would bring home items from his work. </p>
